00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.700
You are looking at Dove, the amazing new beauty discovery.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.100
See, even the shape of this new bath and toilet bar is different, modern, curved to fit your hand.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.500
You use Dove like soap, but Dove is completely new—revolutionary, much better for your skin.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.900
Every bar of Dove is one quarter cleansing cream.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.300
Dove is one quarter cleansing cream.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.700
Soap dries your skin, but Dove creams your skin while you wash.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.100
Dove's rich lather cleans and creams your skin at the same time.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.500
Dove is two blessings in one.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.899
You can feel the cream in Dove; you can smell Dove's creamy fragrance.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.299
Dove leaves your skin—your hands, all of you—soft and smooth.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:59.700
Lever Brothers guarantees that Dove is better for your skin than any soap, or your money back.
